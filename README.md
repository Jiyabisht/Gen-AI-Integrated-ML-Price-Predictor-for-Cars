# Gen-AI Integrated ML Price Predictor for Cars 🚗

This project is a smart tool designed to help users estimate the fair market value of used cars. By combining **Machine Learning** with **Generative AI**, it provides not just a price tag, but also intelligent insights about the deal.

### 💡 What It Does
* **Predicts Price:** Uses a Machine Learning model trained on historical car sales data to calculate an accurate price based on the car's make, model, year, fuel type, and mileage.
* **Smart Analysis:** Integrates Generative AI to provide a "human-like" review of the car, offering negotiation tips and explaining why the car is priced that way.
* **Easy Interface:** Features a simple dashboard built with Streamlit where you can select car details and get instant results.

### 🎯 Goal
To make buying and selling used cars transparent and easier by providing data-driven price estimates backed by AI reasoning.
